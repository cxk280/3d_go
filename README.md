Epic user story: As a user who understands the rules of Go, 
I want to be able to play a game in an interface that is enjoyable, 
non-monotonous and intuitive.

Smaller user stories:
1: As a user who does not know the rules of Go, I want to see 
a tutorial that teaches me the rules.
2: As a user who understands the rules of Go, I want the ability to 
select at the beginning whether I am player black or white.
3: As a user who understands the rules of Go, I want to place my stone 
at the board square on which I click.
4: As a user who understands the rules of Go, I want to see a running 
tally of my score and my opponents.
5: As a user who understands the rules of Go, I want the ability to pass 
my turn.

Note: The game of Go ends when both players pass turns consecutively.

Stretch goals:

1: As a user who understand the rules of Go, I want the ability to play 
online with a human friend viewing their own interface on their own 
computer.
2: As a user who understands the rules of Go, I want the 
the option to play Go in three dimensions (actual 3D gameplay, 
not just 3D graphics). This would require an abstraction of 
the traditional rules into a three dimensional space.
