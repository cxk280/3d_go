Epic user story: As a user who understands the rules of Go, 
I want to be able to play a game that is enjoyable.

Smaller user stories:
1. As a user who does not know the rules of Go, I want to see 
a tutorial that teaches me how to play.

2. As a user who understands the rules of Go, I want my game 
interface designed non-monotonously and intuitively.

3. As a user who is familiar with online options for playing 
Go, which are predominantly 2D, I want this game to offer 
pleasing 3D graphics.

4. As a user who understands the rules of Go, I want the 
the option to play Go in three dimensions (actual 3D gameplay, 
not just 3D graphics). This would require an abstraction of 
the traditional rules into a three dimensional space.
